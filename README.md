# CentralNic Registry WHMCS Plugin

[![CI](https://github.com/gbxyz/centralnic-registry-whmcs-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gbxyz/centralnic-registry-whmcs-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/gbxyz/centralnic-registry-whmcs-plugin/graph/badge.svg?token=PLWL4ISS79)](https://codecov.io/gh/gbxyz/centralnic-registry-whmcs-plugin)

This repository contains a plugin for WHMCS that interacts with the [CentralNic Registry](https://centralnicregistry.com) EPP server.
It should also work with the [SK-NIC](https://sk-nic.sk) and [LANIC](https://www.lanic.gov.la) systems, which run the same software, although you will need to change the EPP server hostname.
It should also work with any standards-compliant EPP server, although this is not guaranteed.

This plugin should not be confused with the [CentralNic Reseller](https://docs.whmcs.com/CentralNic_Reseller) plugin for WHMCS.
