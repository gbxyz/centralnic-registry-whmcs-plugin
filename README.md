# CentralNic WHMCS Plugin

This repository contains a greenfield plugin for WHMCS, that interacts with the CentralNic Registry EPP server. Unlike the "legacy"
plugin, it does not use an external EPP library.

It implements many more of the available plugin functions, and also has a modicum of unit testing.
