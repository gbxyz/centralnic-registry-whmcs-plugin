# CentralNic WHMCS Plugin

This repository contains a greenfield plugin for WHMCS, that interacts with the CentralNic Registry EPP server. Unlike the "legacy"
plugin, it does not use an external EPP library.

It implements much more of the available plugin functions, and also has unit testing covering most of the codebase.
